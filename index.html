          See the old PBR NORMAL MAP and then See the new PBR NORMAL MAP texture you will simply see the differece in the new texture you will got more detailing and realism than other texture packs . if you're confused so there is a simple explanation . PBR means Physically Based Rendering . PBR only controlls , roughness , metalness , spectular , ambient occlussion and smoothness and the shadow and the light direction . pBR calulates the diredtion of light and then according to the inputs it draws the shadows on the 2d object or image in the 3d project . In simple language PBR creates 2d images into 3d objects with a illussion . and according to the images shown at the top you can realise the pbr and it's realism of the game .
